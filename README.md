# PollinationJail - CTF Challenge
 - Author: Gameboy612
 - Category: Misc
 - Difficulty: Easy

## Description
WolframAlpha is a powerful computational engine, but it has a lot of limitations... I recently found out Pollinations AI has been giving away free LLM API calls! Why not just make a WolframAlpha clone using Pollinations? It can even execute Python code! Why did no one think of this before?

There are two flags to this challenge, and they are both in the format `pollin{...}`.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

2. Build and run the Docker container using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

3. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.
